========================

The player moves up, down, right and left using the arrows on the keyboard.

The main goal of the game is the player to cross the blocks and reach the water.
You have to be careful with the bugs! Everytime you collide with a bug you lose
20 points and go back to the initial position. 

Every time you reach the water you get 100 points!

The game starts at level 1 and goes until 8. 
When you reach 1,000 points you go to the next level.
You'll have more bugs coming or they can come faster.
 

Enjoy the game !!!
